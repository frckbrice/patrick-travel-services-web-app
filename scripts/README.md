**Cron schedule:**

- Runs daily at 2:00 AM
- Logs saved to `logs/gdpr-deletions.log`

**Manual cron setup:**
If you prefer to set up manually:

```bash
crontab -e
```

Add this line:

```
0 2 * * * cd /path/to/project && npx tsx scripts/process-scheduled-deletions.ts >> /path/to/project/logs/gdpr-deletions.log 2>&1
```

## 🚀 Deployment Options

### Option 1: Vercel Cron (Recommended for Vercel deployments)

The app includes Vercel Cron configuration in `vercel.json`:

```json
{
  "crons": [
    {
      "path": "/api/cron/scheduled-deletions",
      "schedule": "0 2 * * *"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Setup:**

1. Add `CRON_SECRET` to your Vercel environment variables:

   ```
   CRON_SECRET=your-random-secret-key-here
   ```

2. Deploy to Vercel - cron job is automatically configured

3. Verify in Vercel Dashboard → Settings → Cron Jobs

**Endpoint:** `GET /api/cron/scheduled-deletions`

**Security:** Requires `CRON_SECRET` in Authorization header

---

### Option 2: Traditional Cron (VPS/Self-hosted)

Use the setup script:

```bash
./scripts/setup-cron.sh
```

Or set up manually with crontab (see above).

---

### Option 3: GitHub Actions (Alternative)

Create `.github/workflows/scheduled-deletions.yml`:

```yaml
name: GDPR Scheduled Deletions

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 2 * * *' # Daily at 2:00 AM UTC
  workflow_dispatch: # Allow manual trigger

jobs:
  delete-scheduled-accounts:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Run deletion script
        env:
          DATABASE_URL: ${{ secrets.DATABASE_URL }}
          FIREBASE_ADMIN_SDK: ${{ secrets.FIREBASE_ADMIN_SDK }}
        run: npx tsx scripts/process-scheduled-deletions.ts
```

---

## 🧪 Testing the Deletion Script

### Test with staging data:

1. Create a test user:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "test-delete@example.com",
    "password": "Test123!@#",
    "firstName": "Test",
    "lastName": "Delete"
  }'
```

2. Request account deletion:

```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/api/users/account \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"reason": "Testing deletion"}'
```

3. Manually set deletion date to past (in database):

```sql
UPDATE "User"
SET "deletionScheduledFor" = NOW() - INTERVAL '1 day'
WHERE email LIKE 'deleted_%test-delete%';
```

4. Run the script:

```bash
npx tsx scripts/process-scheduled-deletions.ts
```

5. Verify user is deleted:

```sql
SELECT * FROM "User" WHERE email LIKE '%test-delete%';
-- Should return no results
```

## 📊 Monitoring & Logs

### View logs (traditional cron):

```bash
tail -f logs/gdpr-deletions.log
```

### View logs (Vercel):

Check Vercel Dashboard → Functions → Logs

### Key metrics to monitor:

- Number of users deleted per day
- Any errors during deletion
- Deletion success rate
- Time taken for deletions

### Database query to check pending deletions:

```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(*) as pending_deletions,
  MIN("deletionScheduledFor") as next_deletion_date
FROM "User"
WHERE "deletionScheduledFor" IS NOT NULL
  AND "deletionScheduledFor" <= NOW();
```

---

## 🔐 Security Considerations

### Vercel Cron Security:

- Always use `CRON_SECRET` in production
- Rotate `CRON_SECRET` periodically
- Monitor cron endpoint for unauthorized access

### Traditional Cron Security:

- Ensure cron runs with correct user permissions
- Protect log files (may contain user IDs)
- Set up log rotation to prevent disk space issues

### Script Security:

- Script uses database transactions for atomicity
- Continues processing other users if one fails
- Never exposes PII in logs (only user IDs)
- Firebase deletion errors don't block database cleanup

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Problem: Cron job not running

**Solution:**

```bash
# Check if cron service is running
sudo service cron status

# Check crontab is installed
crontab -l

# Check cron logs
grep CRON /var/log/syslog
```

### Problem: Script fails with database connection error

**Solution:**

- Verify DATABASE_URL is set correctly
- Check database server is accessible
- Ensure Prisma client is generated: `npx prisma generate`

### Problem: Firebase deletion fails

**Solution:**

- Verify FIREBASE_ADMIN_SDK credentials are correct
- Check Firebase Admin SDK is initialized
- Script continues even if Firebase fails (database is cleaned up)

### Problem: Script runs but no users deleted

**Solution:**

```bash
# Check if any users are scheduled for deletion
npx prisma studio
# Navigate to User table, filter by deletionScheduledFor

# Or run SQL:
# SELECT * FROM "User" WHERE "deletionScheduledFor" IS NOT NULL;
```
